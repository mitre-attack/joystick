# JOYSTICK 
The ATT&CK Evaluations results data contains a wealth of information to allow readers to better understand how capabilities work. At the same time, we recognize that getting a quick, high level understanding of a tool’s performance is difficult. To address this, we developed and released Joystick, an ATT&CK Evaluations data analysis tool.​

## Requirements
- [python3](https://www.python.org/) (3.7+)
- Google Chrome is our only supported/tested browser

## Installation
Start by cloning this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/mitre-attack/joystick.git
```
From the root of this project, install the PIP requirements.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then start the server.
```
python joystick.py
```
Once the server has started, point your browser to localhost:8000, and start browsing through evaluation results.

## Intended Use
Please note that Joystick is currently intended to be used as a local, single user application. 

## How do I contribute?

We welcome all the help we can get in making Joystick a more useful tool for the community. We have made a working prototype and acknowledge that there will need to be increased efforts in the future to maintain and improve it.
